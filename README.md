# counting_from_None_to_100_without_using_numbers
Target: count from 0 to 100 using None and minimum number of calls  
Rules: no numbers, operators, imports ,using any additional code, non-round brackets, quotes, dots and commas. Every sequence must contain 'None'  

Noitce: some solutions may not work on different devices, but my priority was to shorten number of calls as possible
